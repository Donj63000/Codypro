# Prestataires Manager

This project is a small JavaFX application used to manage service providers ("prestataires").
It stores information in a local SQLite database and offers a GUI to:

- List, create and edit providers
- Record services performed for each provider
- Search through records
- Export provider sheets and a global history as PDF files

## Requirements

- JavaÂ 17 or later
- Maven

## Running the application

At the repository root simply run:

```bash
mvn javafx:run
```

Maven downloads the required JavaFX dependencies and launches `org.example.MainApp`.

You can also build the project into a JAR with:

```bash
mvn package
```

The resulting archive will be located under `target/`.
